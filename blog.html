				<h3>Seeing true Beau-Tea All Around Us.</h3>
				<p>It has come to my attention recently that Tea is actually all around us. This isn’t one of those cheesy metaphors like in August rush where they say that music is actually all around us and connecting us and blah blah blah, I’m serious. See Tea by definition is “Tea – An aeromatic beverage commonly prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over cured leaves” And look around you, leaves are EVERYWHERE! Okay, this is when things get a little weird, I’d like to take this moment to apologize for any confusing happenstances that may arise.</p>
				<p>Lets start by going back to the beginning, Saturday. As per uge, my roommate Kyle was searching for a tea, not satisfied by his packaged goodies and premade blends, he decided he wanted something more floral, more natural. So in typical Kyle fashion, he went to the back yard, found a few nice wild flowers and proceeded to fry and then steep tea with them. The strange part, it wasn’t half bad, the stranger part, Im still alive after drinking it! So this got me thinking, what isn’t tea? Sure there are some obvious ones here like poison ivy and poison oak, and pretty much anything with the word poison in it..and we should probably stay away from cacti and other succulents while were at it, but what else?</p>
				<p>That is my challenge to you this week, Go out, boldly go where no one has gone before, venture deep into the unknown, pick flowers, and brew them. Make a tea! Good luck to all!</p>

				<h3>Green, Oolong, or Black? The Debate Continues.</h3>
				<p>So what is up with Oolong tea? Like seriously? How is it so good? What about black tea? What makes it so delicious and strong? And of course nothing can be more refreshing than a good glass of green tea. So what if I told you that they are actually all the same thing? Don’t believe me? Google it. Actually don’t bother because I did it for you. What Google will tell you is that “Oolong tea is a product made from the leaves, buds, and stems of the Camellia sinensis plant. This is the same plant that is also used to make black tea and green tea. The difference is in the processing. Oolong tea is partially fermented, black tea is fully fermented, and green tea is unfermented.” Holy Smokes Batman! How is that possible? How can one little plant be some awesome?! Because of science and reasons, that how. This is really just an appreciation post for the Camellia Sinesis plant, the Godfather of all teas. I feel blessed and honored to drink it’s hot leaf juice. So back to the debate, which is better, Green, oolong, or black? Answer, It doesn’t matter! They are all great and they all come from the same plant, its like they are all family its pointless to pick your favorite! And in the words of our wise cofounder, “Both, Why Choose?”</p>
