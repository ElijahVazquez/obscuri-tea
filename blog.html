				<p>Obscuri-Tea was founded by three men and a pug in Portland Oregon in 2010. One night after debating which Wes Anderson movie truly displayed the purest expression of pretentious disinterest, we decided to get ourselves a PBR.

There, sipping our constant comet herbal infused citrus tea, we had the idea for Obsuci-Tea. Why isn't there a designated Tea House for those who seek true quality? What was stopping us from creating it? Nothing.<br><a href=#>read more ></a></p>
