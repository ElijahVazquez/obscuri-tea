Hey Everyone! I linked to google's hosted Jquery but feel free to change that if you prefer. If you do though, just make a note of it.

I've made the basics, and used a reset stylesheet. If you need to change anything just do it and make a note of it when you push it. 
	Unless its a big important change that we need to know asap, then text us and do it.

I like notes, I hope someone actually reads this. Cool cool cool.

***Naming conventions:
	I think we should use classes with the page name, underscore, then the specific element(if you need multiple words then go to camel case otherwise all lowercase.)
	EX: .home_hours OR .home_blogSection
	Cool?

Also, If at all possible, use rgba() because its awesome and Alpha is great.
